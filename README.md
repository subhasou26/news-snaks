A new News app using flutter

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
n June 2023, I made a news paper app using flutter . In the app I use a news company's API to get the news. This is a sort news app. I also impliment web view in the app to get more news by opening the actual web site of that perticuler news. I also place image on the app for every perticuler news.
